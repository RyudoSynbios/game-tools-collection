  <Spoiler title="How can i repair my corrupted save?">
    <p>
      Most games use checksums to validate if a save has been altered or not.
      Checksums are values calculated by making more or less complex operations
      on all the data in the save file.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you load your save, the game will calculate the checksum and compare
      with what it saved previously. If the result is the same, the save can be
      loaded, otherwise, it is indicated as corrupted and depending on the game,
      the save can be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tools present on the site recalculate the checksums every time you
      save, even if you don't edit anything, which can repair your save if it is
      corrupted.

    <p>In most cases, yes.</p>
    <p>
      Save editors can detect the format of a save file and adapt the values to
      allow the edition.
